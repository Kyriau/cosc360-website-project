A large portion of the project is unimplemented because I ran out of time.
Relevant GitHub: https://github.com/Kyriau/cosc360-website-project

Features (By Marking Rubric)
1) Posts, threads, and user profiles can be viewed while or while not logged-in as an account.
2) Flexbox is used to scale elements corresponding to window size.
3) Server stores password hashes in an SQL database and validates user login. User login uses PHP sessions.
4) Searches unimplemented, but would be done using forms and MySQL's "LIKE".
5) No Javascript form validation implemented; currently only some HTMl and PHP validation.
6) Users can register to the site, including with a user image.
7) Users can log into the site with username and password, and login is checked against the password hash stored in database.
8) Users can post threads and reply to existing threads. This information is stored in the database.
9) Users can view their profile, but not edit it.
10) No password recovery is implemeneted.
11) Many secions of PHP perform some error handling, but sending error responses to the user is largely unimplemented. Requesting a missing page only outputs the standard apache 404 page.
12) User login status is stored using PHP sessions, so users can close browser, reopen, and still be logged in.
13) through 15) Administrator status is stored in the User table, but there is no functionality implemented.

Additional Features
1) Thread activity within forums is sorted by the time of the most recent reply.
2) Forms to post and reply to threads are only displayed while a user is logged in.
